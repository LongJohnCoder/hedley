# Experimental Macros

These may, one day, migrate to Hedley.  Or not.  For now they live
here, partly in hope that someone will find them to be a useful, and
partly to make sure I don't lose the progress.

If you do find them useful, please let me knowâ€¦ if nothing else, I'm
more likely to move them over to Hedley if lots of people find them
useful.

The implementations are a bit strange in that I use `elif ... || 1`
instead of else.  This is so I can keep track of what compilers I've
tested or checked the documentation for but don't, AFAICT, support the
feature.  If you have access to a compiler not already included please
add it and send a PR.
